## THIS IS AN EXAMPLE ENV FILE ##
##
## it should be saved as '.env.[name]' where [name] corresponds to the first argument passed to 'csv-to-mongo.js'
##
## e.g.:
##      env file name: '.env.Question'
##      command to run script: 'node etl/csv-to-mongo.js Question'

COLLECTION_NAME='Answer'          # the MongoDB collection name to insert data into
CSV_PATH='answers.csv'            # path to the CSV relative to the script file
FAILED_PATH='answers.failed.txt'  # path to the file that collects error data
START_DELAY = 5000      # delay before starting
ERROR_DELAY = 2000      # delay after encountering an error (usually that line would be skipped)
CHUNK_DELAY = 0         # delay between chunks
CHUNK_MAX_SIZE = 20000  # num of rows to chunk before inserting

NUM_COLS=8 # needs to be equal to the number of columns defined below

##  COL INDEX:    0 |     1     |  2 |      3     |      4      |       5      |    6   |   7  |
##  CSV DATA:     id,question_id,body,date_written,answerer_name,answerer_email,reported,helpful
##
##  if a column should be ignored, set it to null.
##  e.g.:  COL4=null
COL0='_id'
COL1='question_id'
COL2='body'
COL3='date_written'
COL4='answerer_name'
COL5='answerer_email'
COL6='reported'
